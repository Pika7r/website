                    <p>Nature is an inherent character or constitution,[1] particularly of the ecosphere or the universe
                        as a whole. In this general sense nature refers to the laws, elements and phenomena of the
                        physical world, including life. Although humans are part of nature, human activity or humans as
                        a whole are often described as at times at odds, or outright separate and even superior to
                        nature.[2]

                        During the advent of modern scientific method in the last several centuries, nature became the
                        passive reality, organized and moved by divine laws.[3][4] With the Industrial revolution,
                        nature increasingly became seen as the part of reality deprived from intentional intervention:
                        it was hence considered as sacred by some traditions (Rousseau, American transcendentalism) or a
                        mere decorum for divine providence or human history (Hegel, Marx). However, a vitalist vision of
                        nature, closer to the pre-Socratic one, got reborn at the same time, especially after Charles
                        Darwin.</p>

                <div class="content">
                    <p>The word nature is borrowed from the Old French nature and is derived from the Latin word natura,
                        or "essential qualities, innate disposition", and in ancient times, literally meant "birth".[5]
                        In ancient philosophy, natura is mostly used as the Latin translation of the Greek word physis
                        (φύσις), which originally related to the intrinsic characteristics of plants, animals, and other
                        features of the world to develop of their own accord.[6][7] The concept of nature as a whole,
                        the physical universe, is one of several expansions of the original notion;[2] it began with
                        certain core applications of the word φύσις by pre-Socratic philosophers (though this word had a
                        dynamic dimension then, especially for Heraclitus), and has steadily gained currency ever since.

                <div class="content">
                    <p>A forest is an ecosystem characterized by land dominated by trees.[1] Hundreds of definitions of
                        forest are used throughout the world, incorporating factors such as tree density, tree height,
                        land use, legal standing, and ecological function.[2][3][4] The United Nations' Food and
                        Agriculture Organization (FAO) defines a forest as, "Land spanning more than 0.5 hectares with
                        trees higher than 5 meters and a canopy cover of more than 10 percent, or trees able to reach
                        these thresholds in situ. It does not include land that is predominantly under agricultural or
                        urban use."[5] Using this definition, Global Forest Resources Assessment 2020 (FRA 2020) found
                        that forests covered 4.06 billion hectares (10.0 billion acres; 40.6 million square kilometres;
                        15.7 million square miles), or approximately 31 percent of the world's land area in 2020.[6]

                        Forests are the largest terrestrial ecosystem of Earth by area, and are found around the
                        globe.[7] 45 percent of forest land is in the tropical latitudes. The next largest share of
                        forests are found in subarctic climates, followed by temperate, and subtropical zones[8]

                        Forests account for 75% of the gross primary production of the Earth's biosphere, and contain
                        80% of the Earth's plant biomass. Net primary production is estimated at 21.9 gigatonnes of
                        biomass per year for tropical forests, 8.1 for temperate forests, and 2.6 for boreal forests.
